# Exploration of Loan Data from Prosper 

## Dataset

In this project, I use Loan data from Prosper. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. A detailed list of the variables and their meaning is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0). <br><br>
I remove the columns I do not need and, I was left with 41 variables. <br><br>

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I find the following: <br>
- monthly payment increases with the loan original amount.<br>
- those with a higher income range had higher loan amounts and higher monthly payments.<br>
- there appears to be no visible difference in the relationship between the loan amount and monthly payment for the loans that were problematic to close and those that were unproblematic.<br>
- investigating further by the employment status, there is still no visible difference in the relationship between the loan amount and monthly payment for the loans that were problematic to close and those that were unproblematic.<br><br>


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the following questions:
1. Which factors affect the borrowerâ€™s interest rate?
2. Which factors affect the ability of borrowers to close loans?<br>

For the first question, I find that home owners have lower interest rates that those who do not own homes. The median interest rate for those with no public records is lower than for those with public records. In addition, those with higher credit scores have lower interest rates.<br><br>
For the second question, I find that higher interest rates are associated with the loans that are problematic to close. The loans that are problematic to close have more borrowers with lower/ worse credit scores than the loans that are unproblematic.<br><br>
